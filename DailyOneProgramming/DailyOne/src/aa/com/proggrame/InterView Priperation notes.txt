What is encapsulation ? why they are provided in our oop principle?

 - encapsulation is the one of oop principle.
 - the prosses of wraping up of variables and methods as single unit by using class
 - & operating those variables only via methods either for reading or modifiting values is called Encapsulation.

 - by developing encapsulation we are hiding data from direct access from other object ; 
 - and providing those access via publiccly available getter & setter () method with proper validation.

- hence through encapsulation we will get security to object data,reusability,centialised modification to object code.

- 2 types of encapsulatio::: 1.week encapsulation(one private another non private)
                                                2.strong encapsultion(all member's are private or final.)
